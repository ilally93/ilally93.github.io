      My name is Isabel Lally.  I am originally from Long Beach, CA but now live in Ladson, SC.  
    I am majoring in computer science at College of Charleston and am planning on graduating 
    May 2021.  After graduation, I would like to work either in bioinformatics or at an aerospace 
    company.  On the weekends, I work as a vet assistant at Northwoods Veterinary Clinic.  Over 
    the summer, I had an internship at MUSC working in their Biomedical Informatics Center.  In 
    my spare time, I like to go horseback riding, go to the beach, read, and hang out with my cats.  
    This blog is mostly going to include homework assignments and projects I'm working on related 
    to computer science, in and out of school, but might evolve into something more!
