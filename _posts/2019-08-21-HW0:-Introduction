    My name is Isabel Lally.  I am originally from Long Beach, CA but now live in Ladson, SC.  I am majoring in computer science at College of Charleston and am planning on graduating May 2021.  After graduation, I would like to work either in bioinformatics or at an aerospace company.  On the weekends, I work as a vet assistant at Northwoods Veterinary Clinic.  Over the summer, I had an internship at MUSC working in their Biomedical Informatics Center.  In my spare time, I like to go horseback riding, go to the beach, read, and hang out with my cats.  This blog is mostly going to include homework assignments and projects I'm working on related to computer science, in and out of school, but might evolve into something more!
