  Exercise 10.6:

      It is reasonable to assume that the use of dependable processes 
    will lead to the creation of dependable software bassed on the SE 
    code of ethics.  Part of the code of ethics is to be honest about 
    skill level and what you can accomplish.  Knowing these limitations 
    will help and lead into getting help from specialists in fields
    that you don't have knowledge in.  Principle 3 includes adequately 
    testing and debuging your software and documentation, which if done 
    correctly will lead to a dependable software.

  Exercise 10.10:

      The need for regulation does not inhibit innovation and regulations 
    do not force the use of older methods of systems development.  None 
    of the principles from the SE code of ethics would inhibit innovation, 
    if anything they encourage innovation.  The principles involve life 
    long learning as well as getting assistance from other people, both 
    of which include creativity and innovation.  Taking away the 
    regulations would just lead to unreliable software with questionable 
    reputations and integrity.
