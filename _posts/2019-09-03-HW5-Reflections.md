      This morning I woke up to an article* sent from my mom about artificial
    intelligence being used in health care.  The timing of being sent the article 
    was interesting because of the articles we were meant to read talked some about 
    healthcare.  The article I was sent focused on AI sorting people with pneumonia 
    into low risk and high risk categories.  The sorting worked pretty well, except 
    for in the case of asthmatics.  The people with asthma were sorted into the low 
    risk category when diagnosed with asthma.
    
      Similarly, there were articles on radiation being misdosed in some of the 
    articles we were meant to read.  The problems in these medical cases is that 
    the software needs to be checked on by humans still.  Neither of these software 
    are/ were ready to be used in the healthcare field.  The AI with asthma is 
    still in the testing phase, which is good.  It seems like the radiation machine 
    was not tested correctly though.  It is likely that since the previous models 
    of the machines worked just fine, then testing may have been cut short.
    
      The article "Why Software Projects Fail, and the Traps You Can Avoid That 
    Could Spell Disaster", lists insufficient testing as one of the problems.  
    The other "traps" mentioned are lack of time, poor planning, unclear 
    requirements, too many cooks in the kitchen, and poor project management.  
    The FBI Sentinel Project seemed to carry many of these traits that cause 
    software failure.
    
      The sentinel project went over budget,
