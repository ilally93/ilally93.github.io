      My short term memory is horrendous.  That was all I could
    think about when reading "The Magic Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two", the Wikipedia page, well that and the idea of memory palaces.  I know memory palaces don't have much to do with the article apart from having the same topic of memory.  All I know is that my memory is awful and I have had no luck with memory palaces, but I don't think that really what I'm supposed to be getting out of this reading exactly.  And don't worry, I write a lot of things down, so I don't forget.

      Looking at the magic number article, the part that felt most relevant
    was about different sounds correlating to a different task a person would complete.  The inputs, the sounds, were one-to-one with the outputs, the actions in this case.  Relating this back to software and particularly testing, an input is being given and there is an expected output and depending on the real output, you can test whether the software worked in that case, just like humans.

      "Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)" by Scott W. Ambler,
    discusses testing in the same way of having an input and having a known output to match up against the actual output.  The interesting part about TDD though is how it's implemented and how it actually drives the development process.  The idea is to make simple test cases that are made to fail initially, because those parts of the software haven't been implemented yet, and then to work until the test passes.  Using this method of development seems like a great way to make sure that requirement specifications are being met, as discussed in Chapter 4 of our textbook.  If you have good specifications that are thorough and testable, the process will be extremely simple.  

      Security surrounding cars has been a big deal in the recent years.
    I remember last year in Introduction to Cybersecurity, we watched a youtube video of just some guy hacking cars (and not even new cars that have the more complex navigations and extra sensors) and what he could do was pretty terrifying.  If he had physical access to the car, he was able to just plug in a small device that then gave him access from outside the car.  He could drive the car as long as he was close enough.  I know in the past few years, Tesla has encouraged people to hack their cars, promising large amounts of money, if someone was able to find a weak point in their system.  Actually, a really good way of testing the security of their cars with people from all different backgrounds and experiences as well.
