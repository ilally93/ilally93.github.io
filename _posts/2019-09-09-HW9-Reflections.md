      Predicting where software and programming is heading is a very loaded
    question.  I do actually agree with most of the article, "11 Predictions
    for the Future of Programming".  The cloud has been growing more popular
    for a while now and with Microsoft Azure making an appearance, things
    seem to be moving even more.  And really, who can stand a website that
    won't load within 3 seconds.  Patience is a virtue and most of us happen
    to not have that virtue.

      The authors second point is about IOT security and how it needs to
    grow.  If you aren't convinced that this is needed and needed now, just
    go to Dr. X's research lab.  She has all types of smart home devices just
    waiting to be hacked.  If you don't want to take a walk, head on over to
    youtube and watch how easy it is to hack into a baby monitor (super
    creepy).

      Next idea is videos dominating the web, which is what's happening and
    as we get more and more streaming services that's how it's going to be
    for a while.  Consoles, consoles everywhere - I do see this one being
    true as well.  People my age grew up on game consoles and if I'm going to
    be honest a handheld with a new Pokemon game takes me back to playing
    Pokemon Yellow on my Game Boy Color (Pikachu edition, obviously) in the
    back seat of the car.  The nostalgia is real.

      Alternatively, I think the author is discrediting PC gaming big time
    and PCs in general, when he discusses user interface design.  Let me just
    roll back on this nostalgia train for one more minute.  Original World of
    Warcraft, all the Halo games, Final Fantasy Remastered.  Has this person
    ever even heard of Minecraft?  People are building their own PCs now more
    than ever and I'm not just talking about our geeky selves in the computer
    science department.  I know geologists and teachers and speech
    pathologists who all built their own computers and on top of that,
    they're all amazing women so let's squash those stereotypes right there.  

      Machine learning is here and it's going to be here in so many different
    fields which is so awesome.  I've had the chance to work with some of it
    in the medical field and it's being discussed so much.  There are so many
    ideas and they are so close to working, but not quite there yet.  It is
    being used in self driving cars and that whole concept will hopefully
    become more cost efficient and widely accepted soon.  We're definitely
    heading that way already.

      As for laws, with all evolving technology there should be new laws
    and regulations.  As for if that always happens as it should, I'm not
    going to comment on.  

      I hope people continue down the open source path.  Building off of one
    another, creates so much more advancement and innovation that keeping
    things closed almost seems cruel.  It's also just a great learning
    experience for someone to mess around with some open source code.  And
    finally, as for containers I actually disagree with "11 Predictions for
    the future of Programming".  Containers may not be the most exciting
    things to work on and they might not be the first thing to get rid of,
    but I believe people will change from containers in the coming years.
