  Exercise 5.3:

    Q: You have been asked to develop a system that will help with planning
       large-scale events and parties such as weddings, graduation celebrations,
       and birthday parties.  Using an activity diagram, model the process
       context for such a system that shows the activities involved in planning
       a party (booking a venue, organizing invitations, etc.) and the system
       elements that might be used at each stage.

  Exercise 5.5:

    Q: Develop a sequence diagram showing the interactions involved when a
       student registers for a course in a university.  Courses may have limited
       enrollment, so the registration process must include checks that places
       are available.  Assume that the student accesses and electronic course
       catalog to find out about available courses.


  Exercise 5.7:

    Q: Based on your experience with a blank ATM, draw an activity that models
       the data processing involved when a customer withdraws cash from the
       machine.



  Exercise 5.8:

    Q: Draw a sequence diagram for the same system.  Explain why you might want
       to develop both activity and sequence diagrams when modeling the
       behavior of a system.
