      The first 4 chapters of "Mythical Man Month" by Frederick P. Brooks is an
    interesting read and I agreed with some points, just not all.  Chapter one
    is titled "The Tar Pit", which I enjoyed the imagery.  It reminded me of
    visiting the La Brea Tar Pits when I was younger.  Past the imagery, I sort
    of lost how the chapter related to the tar pit.  

      The second chapter is titled the same as the book.  This was probably
    my least favorite chapter.  The first part I got stuck on was that "all
    programmers are optimists".  Maybe that was true in 1975, but I don't see
    that today.  Maybe it's just the people I associate with or the cynicism of
    millennials, but we don't feel great about anything.  Do we ever think that
    our code will be done on time and work perfectly?  Either way, we're given
    due dates and budgets and told we need to stick to them, that's life (it's
    also life that they probably won't stay on track).  The other part that
    bothered me, wasn't really related to the meaning of the chapter, but that
    the only time women were mentioned was related to pregnancy.  I think that
    is also related to the article being written in 1975.

      Brooks did actually make some very valid points in chapter two, that I
    do I agree with.  The idea of a man-month, meaning that one man can be
    exchanged for one month of work, does only work in a specific situation.  
    If tasks can easily be split, this might now be exact still, but will help
    cut down on the time of the project.  However, if the tasks are unable to
    be split, there are too many cooks in the kitchen and people will also be
    sitting around.  Another point he brings up is something I experienced in
    my internship this summer.  I had to be onboarded, which did take a while
    and it obviously costed more money to add me in like that.  It was a great
    experience though and I learned a lot even just from those first two weeks
    of onboarding.

      The next essay discussed the surgical team.  I don't love the idea of
    having a group set up like a surgical team.  I agree there needs to be
    a leader of sort which will make final decisions in some cases, but only
    when the team can't come to a resolution.  When using the surgical team
    set-up, I just feel like you lose a lot of different suggestions from
    people who have different experiences and backgrounds.  Chapter four fell
    into a similar idea of democracies vs. aristocracies.  

      The different point made in chapter four though is about conceptual
    integrity.  This is the idea of all parts of the software needing to work
    and integrate with each other.  This means ideas and implementation have to
    be clearly communicated and it may be better to leave out little "extras",
    because they are more likely to be incohesive.  The first few chapters have
    brought up interesting points over all, regardless of if I feel the same
    way about them.
