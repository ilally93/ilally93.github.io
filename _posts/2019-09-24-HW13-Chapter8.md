  Exercise 8.7:
    Q: Write a scenario that could be used to help design tests for the
       wilderness weather station system.

      If I were designing tests for the wilderness weather station system,
    I would probably set stations up at multiple locations with varying
    weather systems.  There should be different temperatures, altitudes, and
    humidity levels.  Lab testing would be a good place to start, but
    eventually they do need to be set in places that have hazards as well.

  Exercise 8.10:
    Q: A common approach to system testing is to test the system until the
       testing budget is exhausted and then deliver the system to customers.
       Discuss the ethics of this approach for systems that are delivered to
       external customers.

      The approach to testing until the testing budget is exhausted and then
    delivering the system to the customers doesn't seem exactly ethical.  
    A good part of testing is user testing and if there's no budget left to
    fix the problems, that's a problem. A positive to user testing is that
    by the customers using the software how they intend to actually use it,
    which seems like the best kind of testing to me, apart from security.
