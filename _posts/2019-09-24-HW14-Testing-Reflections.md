      I knew that there was testing in the software development process, but
    I really didn't think it would be this much.  The fact that more of your
    project should be testing than actual coding seems overwhelming.  The
    "Why Testing?" section (1.4.1) in "Software Testing Techniques", that we have discussed in class previously
    is interesting.

      In classes up to this point, we really have been stuck mainly in phase 0,
    testing is no different from debugging, with a small amount of phase 1,
    showing that our code works.  Phase 2, testing to show that code doesn't
    work, seems like an easy enough place to get to, but past that is a
    different way of thinking.  

      Conceptually, I understand phase 3, but it is a frustrating concept.  The
    idea that you can't test to prove that your code or software works, but
    just that you test to a point that the risk of it not working is an
    acceptable is annoying.  It is the same idea for the scientific method that
    nothing can be proven, but things are just not disproven over and over
    again until we feel comfortable calling something a theory.  

      Phase 4, that testing isn't an act, but a mindset seems so abstract that
    I'm not even sure I would know how to get there.  I understand the idea of
    designing code to be testable, though I haven't actually implemented that
    idea yet.  We'll see how designing testable code goes in practice.
