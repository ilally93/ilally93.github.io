  Exercise 15.10:
    Q: The reuse of software raises a number of copyright and intellectual
       property issues. If a customer pays a software contractor to develop a
       system, who has the right to reuse the developed code? Does the software
       contractor have the right to use that code as a basis for a generic
       component? What payment mechanisms might be used to reimburse providers
       of reusable components? Discuss these issues and other ethical issues
       associated with the reuse of software.

      I think with that with who can reuse developed code, whether the contractor
    or the customer, really boils down to the contract made between the two.  In
    real life though, it does become more difficult than that.  What if the
    contract leans on the side of the customer reusing the code, but there are
    minor parts of the code that the developer wants to reuse, what crosses the
    line of copyrighting?  Is it a method, a few methods, a component or multiple
    components?  
      Another ethical concern that comes with software reuse is if someone writes
    code and makes it available for reuse, what if people use the code in a way
    that you don't agree with?  I recently heard of a man who took down his
    personal repo due to a company that was using it signing a contract with ICE.  
    The man who made this project didn't approve of the way ICE is functioning
    and didn't want to support them in anyway ([Article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/developer-takes-down-ruby-library-after-he-finds-out-ice-was-using-it/).  Since this was his
    personal project that was open source, the developer obviously had a right the
    right to take his repo down.
