  Exercise 9.8:
    Q: Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why
       is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?

      If I were designing tests for the wilderness weather station system,
    I would probably set stations up at multiple locations with varying
    weather systems.  There should be different temperatures, altitudes, and
    humidity levels.  Lab testing would be a good place to start, but
    eventually they do need to be set in places that have hazards as well.

  Exercise 9.10:  
    Q: Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code
       that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly
       request it?
