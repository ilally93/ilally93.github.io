  Exercise 9.8:
    Q: Briefly describe the three main types of software maintenance. Why
       is it sometimes difficult to distinguish between them?

      The tree main types of software maintenance are fault repairs, environmental
    adaption, and functionality addition.  It is difficult to distinguish
    between them, because they are often worked on at the same time or they come
    up while working on another one.  When changing the environment, you can
    add new features and bugs may show up in your code that you'll need to fix.

  Exercise 9.10:  
    Q: Do software engineers have a professional responsibility to develop code
       that can be easily maintained even if their employer does not explicitly
       request it?

      I think it should be assumed that your employer would want easily
    maintainable code, but I also think you should be proud of your code and
    want it to be maintainable.  If you create code, you probably want it to be
    functional, even in the future and even if it isn't code specifically owned
    by you.
