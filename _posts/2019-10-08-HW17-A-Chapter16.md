  Exercise 16.9:
    Q: Design the interfaces of components that might be used in a system for
       an emergency control room.  You should design interfaces for a
       call-logging component that records calls made, and a vehicle discovery
       component that, given a post code (zip code) and an incident type, finds
       the nearest suitable vehicle to be dispatched to the incident.
