  Exercise 19.3:
    Q: Why is it impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex
       system from the properties of the system components?

      It is impossible to infer the emergent properties of a complex system from
    the properties of the system components because the functions of the system
    components are dependent on one another.  The properties of the system
    components are impossible to discern from each other and therefore may only
    be seen as a whole through the complex system and not as individual
    components.
      The emergent properties are both the components and the relationships
    between the components.
