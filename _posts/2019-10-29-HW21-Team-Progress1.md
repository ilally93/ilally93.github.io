      Our team is progressing well.  We have written five test case drivers and
    25 test cases.  Our automation is up and running.  There are still some
    errors that we have to work out, but I believe we can do that.
      Our group has a difficult time with write ups as we all just want to
    code... We do all know that the documentation is important though and are
    moving along.  We've added more tasks to our schedule, instead of just
    having deliverables.
      I feel like I have been the one delegating work most recently, even though
    I don't feel like I should be the one to do it.  We work well separately on
    tasks, but struggle to work on tasks together.  Our communication overall
    has been good, but we can get snappy at each other sometimes; We work it out
    though.
      We have mainly been focused on the code, so next steps are definitely
    going to be refining documentation and starting on the poster and slideshow.
