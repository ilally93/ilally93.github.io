  Exercise 21.4:

    Explain why an object-oriented approach to software development may not
    be suitable for real-time systems.

      The object-oriented approach to software development may not be suitable
    for real-time systems due to often using getters and setters which take
    more time when wanting results in real time.  Object oriented is often
    modular which takes additional time as well.  There are ways to use object-
    oriented for real-time systems, but not as object-orients is traditionally
    used.
