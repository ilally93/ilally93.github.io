  Exercise 22.6:

    Fixed-price contracts, where the contractor bids a fixed price to complete
    a system development, may be used to move project risk from client to
    contractor.  If anything goes wrong, the contractor has to pay.  Suggest
    how the use of such contracts may increase the likelihood that project
    risks will arise.

      Project risks may be more likely to arise using fixed-price contracts due
    to the fact that the client may be pickier than usual since the contractor
    would be eating the cost versus the client.  Another reason may be that
    since the contractors are bidding on the project, they may underprice the
    project or offer a sooner completion to beat out competitors, but not be
    able to meet these specifications once they actually win the contract.
