      I feel like our team is doing awesome! We're progressing really well and
    our deliverables are getting more and more on point.  Since we're
    progressing that way, I feel confident our final products will be great.  
    Collin has been doing a lot of the scripting, while Dylan and I have been
    focusing on test cases and drivers.  We had a hard time dealing with
    parsing errors, but we finally made a decision.
      We are having trouble with meeting times, so we have been meeting a little
    less in person and keeping up on discord while we do separate parts.  I
    feel like things are really coming together though and everyone's been
    awesome with keeping up with their work.
