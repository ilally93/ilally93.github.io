  Exercise 24.6:

    Explain why program inspections are an effective technique for
    discovering errors in a program. What types of errors are unlikely to
    be discovered through inspections?

      Program inspections are an effective technique because the program is
    being looked at by someone who has not previously seen the code.  Fresh
    eyes definitely catch more mistakes than someone who has been staring at
    it for hours or days on end.  Additionally, it can be done before having
    to spend time on creating tests and can be done before the code is even
    ready to run.
      Types of errors that are unlikely to be discovered through inspections
    include memory errors, possibly errors that are from different components
    and hard to follow to other components.
