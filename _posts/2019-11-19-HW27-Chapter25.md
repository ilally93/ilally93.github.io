  Exercise 25.10:

    Describe five factors that engineers should take into account during
    the process of building a release of a large software system.

      1) Documentation - A large project needs to contain accurate and
                         extensive documentation to make code easier to
                         maintain.

      2) Branching and Merging - Merge conflicts, as our team found out, are
                                 painful.  In a large project, there has to be
                                 so many conflicts that must be resolved.

      3) Testing - A large software system will need a lot of testing which
                   will take money and time to complete.

      4) Competition - Since large software systems take a long time and money,
                       having a similar system come out before your software
                       could be devastating.  It could cause your system to
                       become useless or possibly charging less to be competitive.

      5) Availability - Often times these large software systems must work
                        across different platforms.  The project is often created
                        on just one platform, but need to be tested and
                        flexible to all.
