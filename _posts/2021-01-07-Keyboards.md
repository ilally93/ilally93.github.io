So, I impulse buy projects.... often.  Obviously quarantining has been
weird for everyone.  I've been at my computer a lot and have started watching
a lot of streamers.  One of those streamers has been [Kristofer Yee](https://www.twitch.tv/kristoferyee), who builds keyboards.  After watching two streams,
I decided, "I'm gonna build a keyboard!".  

I kind of just wanted to start with something cheap so that if I messed up
it wouldn't be a big deal.  Don't tell any of the hardcore keyboard people, but
I did not lube my switches or stabilizers either.

**Parts:**\
    - [Case](https://kbdfans.com/collections/60-layout-case/products/60-plastic-case?variant=36020992077)\
    - [PCB](https://kbdfans.com/collections/60/products/dz60-60-pcb)\
    - [Plate](https://kbdfans.com/collections/60-layout-plate-1/products/dz60-cnc-aluminum-plate)\
    - [Switches](https://kbdfans.com/collections/cherry-switches/products/cherry-rgb-switches-black-red-blue-brown-sliver-10pcs?variant=18561931608122)\
        So I asked Yee's discord about what switches to get, because I do have
        a tremor which makes me double type on keyboards that are too sensitive.  
        I ended up going with the cherry mx blacks based on their suggestion.\
    - [Keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FTGL1RL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)\
    - [Stabilizers](https://kbdfans.com/collections/keyboard-stabilizer/products/gmk-screw-in-stabilizers?variant=22154915348528)

My soldering isn't top notch anymore, but it was simple enough to just solder
the switches into place.

And a final result:

Anyway, it isn't anything fancy, but I'm pretty happy with it.  I think
for my next build I'll go with switches with a little less resistance, but
I am happy for now.  Of course, now I'm obsessed with mechanical keyboards
and I just want to build more.  I find
[this keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox#overview), but it's out of stock.  So obviously, my solution is that I'm going to design
my own keyboard (pcb and case).  Wish me luck!
