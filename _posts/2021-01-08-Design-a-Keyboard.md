title: "Designing a Keyboard?"
date: 2021-01-08

So, as mentioned in my last post, I really liked this [keyboard](https://input.club/devices/infinity-ergodox/infinity-ergodox-build-guide/) which is sold out!  So I thought I could possibly
design a keyboard for myself of a similar style.  

I am planning on using this guide:  
[part1](https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/05/03/designing-a-keyboard-part-1/)  
[part2](https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/05/25/designing-a-keyboard-part2/)  
[part3](https://www.masterzen.fr/2020/10/20/designing-a-keyboard-part3/)  

My first step is designing the PCB, which I will be doing on Kicad.  There are
several [guides](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide)
online about designing PCBs and this specific software.

Before designing the PCB though, I do still need to decide exactly how my keyboard
will look and be sure that I'm not just completely copying that keyboard.  I have
the idea of making it more friendly for coding and having more of the thumb buttons
customizable.
