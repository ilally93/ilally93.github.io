I was born and raised in Long Beach, CA.  In 2016, I moved to Charleston,
SC and started at College of Charleston shortly after.  I will be graduating in May
2021 with a degree in computer science.  Post graduation, I plan to head back
to California.  I like to foster kittens when I have time and have two of my
own (5 I live with in total), Inky and Sunny.  Currently I am the president of the Women in Computing
club at CofC and lead several workshops.  I have just gotten into building
custom mechanical keyboards.  Looking forward to 2021 and hoping to make this
blog look a little nicer this year.
