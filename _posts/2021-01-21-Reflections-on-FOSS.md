My first thought when reading "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" is that it is a
pretty good comparison speaking to the inclusivity of open-source versus
closed-source software.  The cathedral builders would be an exclusive group of
well educated architects, where as the bazaar would be open to everyone including
those architects.  By allowing everyone to participate, it is actually likely
that the bazaar will have more to offer than the cathedral.  In the Wikipedia page
titled "Comparison of open-source and closed-source software", two studies are
mentioned on the code quality of the two software.  One study found that the
quality of code was the same across both software and the other actually found
that the open-source software contained higher quality code.  

My next large topic of interest from the reading is about testing.  Lesson six
in "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" states that "Treating your users as co-developers
is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging".  I
find this to be true for various reasons, but largely because of two.  Those two
reasons include sample size and the fact that users will want the software to be
the absolute best that it can be (or else why bother using it?).  Lesson six leads
directly into lesson seven, which is "Release early.  Release often.  And listen
to your customers.".  Obviously, this is a good statement, but it can bring up
the issue of balancing how early and often is healthy for the software.  If you're
releasing often too early to the point of the software being impossible to work
with, you're going to lose the customers.  I do find it interesting that this was
not largely addressed in the writing.  

Finally, it was interesting to read about the five functions of a software project
manager and how that compares between open-source and closed-source software.
