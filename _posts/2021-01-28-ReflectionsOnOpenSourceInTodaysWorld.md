title: "Reflection on Open Source in Today's World"

I found 3 articles this week to reflect on.  The most on topic article would have
to be ["10 ways to get started with open source in 2021"](https://opensource.com/article/21/1/getting-started-open-source).  The article which I found that spoke to me the most was
["Why failure should be normalized and how to do it"](https://opensource.com/article/20/11/normalize-failure).  And finally, the article I found most amusing was ["How I channel my inner
Star Trek character at work"](https://opensource.com/article/20/11/inner-star-trek).  

The first article, is really just more links to other articles nested within a
few paragraphs, but that took me down a rabbit hole of open source.  One article that
I was linked to summed up reasons for open source perfectly, "build your confidence
as a developer, build your resume, and build your professional network".
