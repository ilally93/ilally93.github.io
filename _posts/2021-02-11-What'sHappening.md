    The make failed not due to other files that I did not mess with.

**Reflection on "Behavioral Science of Software Engineering" and, "Information Needs: Lessons**    
**for Programming Tools" "Gender Inclusivity as a Quality Requirement: Practices and Pitfalls"**

    I actually chose three articles to write about, because I started with "Behavioral
    Science of Software Engineering", which just turned out to be an intro article to
    the rest of this issue.  This led me to the other two articles, "Information Needs:
    Lessons for Programming Tools" and "Gender Inclusivity as a Quality Requirement:
    Practice and Pitfalls".  "Behavioral Science of Software Engineering" introduces the
    idea of studying the cognitive side of technology.  Human behavior is often left out
    computer science and software engineering.  This is a mistake particularly when
    considering things such as AI, UX/UI, NPL, and so much more.  

    "Information Needs: Lessons for Programming Tools" looks at how programming and
    programming tools may be better imagined for human use.  One idea for a tool is
    something that would "assist in feature location, identifying methods involved in
    the implementation of a specific user-facing feature."  After working with our
    open source project, Habitica, that would be so nice!  Android studio does have
    a search all feature, which was extremely helpful in finding the snippets of code
    I needed to find so far, but things could be much better.  This article mentions
    IDEs that have tree format and search functions, however, programmers still have
    issues and can get confused.  

    Another topic brought up in this article is about onboarding new developers.  The
    onboarding process can be intimidating and if contact information or documentation
    are out of date, then that is going to stop people from joining.  Blocking someone
    from even joining just because of poor onboarding is probably the worst way to
    lose help and contributors.  This has been a huge roadblock for me when looking
    to join projects.  It can be intimidating and most people don't create good
    documentation.  The article also discusses how to fix this problem.  One thing
    I found interesting was having cloud-based coding environments which are already
    setup.  This isn't something I have heard of before and would be very interested
    in that, but I know some people are very attached to their usual setups so it
    definitely shouldn't be the only option for a project.  

    The final article that piqued my interest was "Gender Inclusivity as a Quality
    Requirement: Practices and Pitfalls".  The second paragraph says, "What if the
    software you create excludes diverse populations, marginalizing people who 'don't
    fit,' where 'not fitting' can simply arise from the user being different
    from those who created the software?".  This has been a huge issue in voice and
    facial recognition particularly and it's actually an issue being shown on the tv
    show "Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist" currently.  Initially, it was difficult for
    me to think of ways software have inclusivity problems based on gender, but one
    of the first topics brought up was learning styles.  Learning styles aren't
    always gendered, but statistically people have the same learning styles as those
    of the same gender as them.  This article spoke mostly on one way to approach
    these inclusivity problems called (GenderMag)[https://gendermag.org/].  GenderMag
    is actually an open source software as well, which may be worth looking into.  
    The concept still confuses me at this point, but it is to address gender biases
    in problem solving.
