    8.1 Technical Writing  
    Developer and user documentation are important.  
    1.  Organization = how things are arranged and you it can be navigated and
                       accessed.  How easy relevant information can be found is
                       part of organization.  
    2.  Illustration = relation of text, images, other media.  Placement and
                       selection of media can clarify text.  There needs to be a
                       balance for those who learn visually versus just through
                       text.  
    3.  Style = This involves style as far as content of the words as well as how
                the text and media appear.  
    4.  Tone = Who the writer is and who the audience is determines the tone.  

    There can be two separate audiences involving the users, new users and
    experienced users.  This creates both tutorials and manuals.  Writing should
    be clear and simple.
