    **Chapter 6: Database Development**
    Database - data storage organizes for easy retrieval  
             / a collection of tables  
        -   can be flat files or something like a relational database, a distributed
            database, or hierarchical database  
    Databases are persistent, organized, searchable.  
    Relational database: stored as 2-D tables and are a popular type of database  
    SQL: Structure Query Language - database modeling language   
    Query - way to retrieve, insert, update, or delete information from a database  
    Normalized Relational Database Criteria:  
        - rows & columns can be rearranged without any issues  
        - no rows are identical  
        - no hidden components exist in rows  
        - all entry types are correct and have only one value  
        - nothing is redundant  
    Normalization ensures integrity and simplifies querying.  
    Concurrency control prevents collision (when multiple users are trying to update
    the same database information at once).   
        A secure database prevents data from being exposed, changed, or deleted on accident
    or by unauthorized users and ensures data is valid and accurate.  Permissions
    can be used to help secure the database.  Permissions can be based on four
    levels of control: server, database, table, and column.  
    Keep integrity by using the following protocol for "CRUD" functions:
            1. Connect  
            2. Perform "CRUD" (create, retrieve, update, delete)  
            3. Disconnect  
            4. Return results  
    Testing CRUD:
            1. Setup - create table & insert rows (C)  
            2. Test - replace and update rows (R and U)  
            3. Teardown - delete rows (D)
    After database setup = client review!
