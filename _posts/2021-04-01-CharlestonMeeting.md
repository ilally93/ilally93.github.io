    **Charleston Meeting: Charleston Women in Tech**
        I attended a meeting that was part of Charleston Women in Tech's Mentor of the
    Month Series on March 3rd.  The speaker was Valerie Warnock, who talked on
    social media.  
        Valerie Warnock is the Executive Director of Talent with Geocent and has a lot
    of experience in HR.  She started with a survey on what were the most popular
    types of social media among the group for personal was Facebook and then the most
    popular for professional was LinkedIn.  These results were fairly unsurprising
    in my opinion.  She went over how there are really 3 types of social media though
    and went on to include legacy with personal and professional which I found
    interesting.  By legacy, she just meant that social media that we don't actually
    use anymore but it still exists out there.  
        Valerie then shared 3 social media stories.  The first was about how even
    liking a post on Facebook could lead to termination from a job.  We're seeing
    many stories of how people are being fired or getting their college acceptances
    revoked for things they post or comment on social media, but don't hear much
    about that happening with just liked posts or groups, however, it is possible.  
    The second story was a warning about time theft from your company, which included
    things like not calling in sick to work and then posting about being at the
    beach on Instagram on the same day or going live when you're supposed to be
    working.  The final story was actually something she had done while at a bar and
    a guy came over to talk to her.  She was just doing work on her laptop and he
    wasn't really giving up much information on himself.  So, she used the few
    details he did mention to find him on social media and found out what he did
    for work and what company.  She said she kind of freaked him out, but her point
    was to keep personal separate from professional and even recommended having
    duplicate social media with different names.  
        Valerie Warnock then talked about LinkedIn and some tricks and tips relating
    to that.  She suggested that you could add more to LinkedIn that you could
    your resume, that it wasn't as limited.  She also mentioned the recommendations
    feature and balancing how many are given vs. received.  She recommended following
    different companies and being sure to add any certifications that you have.  
        Finally, she recommended doing a "spring cleaning" on your social media,
    which included changing passwords, deleting old accounts, and changing privacy
    settings.
