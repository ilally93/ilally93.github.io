    <p>I was born and raised in Long Beach, CA.  In 2016, I moved to Charleston,
    SC and started at College of Charleston shortly after.  I will be graduating in May
    2021 with a degree in computer science.  Post graduation, I plan to head back
    to California.  I like to foster kittens when I have time and have two of my
    own, Inky and Sunny.  Currently I am the president of the Women in Computing
    club at CofC and lead several workshops.  I have just gotten into building
    custom mechanical keyboards.  Looking forward to 2021 and hoping to make this
    blog look a little nicer this year.  </p>
